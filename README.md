# Customer-Transaction-Data-Cleaning-with-Pandas-Python-Ai
This project demonstrates data cleaning and merging using the Pandas library. It reads customer and transaction data from CSV files, removes duplicate records, and handles missing values (NaNs). The cleaned datasets are then merged and saved to a new file, creating a final, unified dataset for analysis.
