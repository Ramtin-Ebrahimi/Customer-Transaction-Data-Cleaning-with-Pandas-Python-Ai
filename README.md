🚀 Customer Data Cleaning & Preparation Project
A journey from data chaos to actionable insights! This project is a hands-on, end-to-end demonstration of how to clean, manage missing values, deduplicate, and merge two separate datasets using the powerful Pandas library in Python.

The ultimate goal? To transform raw, scattered customer and transaction data into a unified, clean, and analysis-ready dataset perfect for statistical analysis, Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards, and machine learning models.

✨ Key Features
Duplicate Data Management: Identifies and eliminates duplicate customer records to prevent skewed analytics and ensure data integrity.

Handling Missing Values (NaNs): Implements an intelligent strategy to fill in missing data, using the mean for numerical columns and the mode for categorical ones.

Intelligent Data Merging: Combines customer information and transaction records on a common key (customer_id) to create a 360-degree view of each customer.

Clean & Usable Output: Exports the final, polished dataset to a new CSV file, ready to be plugged into any analytics or visualization tool.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Libraries:

Pandas: The core library for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.

Environment: Jupyter Notebook for interactive code execution and step-by-step visualization.

🚦 Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [Your-Repository-Link]
cd [Your-Repository-Folder]
Install the necessary packages: (It's recommended to use a virtual environment)

Bash

pip install pandas jupyter
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Bash

jupyter notebook
Your browser will open automatically. Open the exerciseDataCleaning.ipynb file and run the cells in order (or use Cell > Run All).

See the result: After the notebook has finished running, the finalldata.csv file will be generated in the Data folder. This is your clean, merged dataset!

📈 The Data Cleaning Pipeline
This project functions like a production line, turning raw materials (messy data) into a valuable, finished product.

Data Ingestion:
We start by loading the two datasets, customerinfo.csv and transaction.csv, into Pandas DataFrames.

The Quality Control Station (Data Cleaning):

Deduplication: The customer data is scanned for identical records (based on name, email, address, etc.), and duplicates are removed to ensure each customer is represented only once.

Handling Missing Values:

The transaction data contains empty values (NaNs) in crucial columns like total_amount and date.

These gaps are filled using statistical measures (mean and mode) to preserve the dataset's integrity without losing records.

The Integration Station (Data Merging):
The two clean datasets are merged into one using pd.merge on the common customer_id column. Now, we can easily see which customer bought what, and when.

Final Packaging (The Output):
The final, unified DataFrame is saved to finalldata.csv. This "golden dataset" is now ready to shine in the hands of data analysts and data scientists!
